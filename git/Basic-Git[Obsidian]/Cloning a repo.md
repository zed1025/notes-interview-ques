## What is cloning?
Cloning is exactly what it sounds like: creating a copy, or clone, of a repository. A Git repository tracks the history of all changes inside the repository through a hidden _.git_ directory. 
So since a Git repository is just a special directory, you could, in theory, effect a pretty cheap and dirty clone operation by zipping up all the files in a repository on your friend’s or colleague’s workstation and then emailing it to yourself. When you extract the contents of that zipped-up file, you’d have an exact copy of the repository on your computer.
However, emailing things around can (and does) get messy. Instead, many organizations make use of online repository hosts, such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or others. Some organizations even choose to self-host repositories.
